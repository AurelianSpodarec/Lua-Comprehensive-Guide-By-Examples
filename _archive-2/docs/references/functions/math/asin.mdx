  title: math.asin() 
---

The `math.asin()` function in lua returns the inverse sine (in radians) of a number. That is:  

∀ x ∊ [-1, 1], `math.asin(x)` = `arcsin(x)` = the unique `y ∊ [-π/2, π/2]` such that `sin(y) = x`.  

---

### Syntax  

```lua
math.asin(x)
```

### Parameters  

- `x`  
  A number between `-1` and `1` (inclusive), representing the sine value of an angle.

### Return value  

The inverse sine of `x`, expressed as an angle in radians between `-π/2` and `π/2` (inclusive). If `x` is less than `-1` or greater than `1`, the function returns `nil` or may trigger an error, as the value is undefined in these cases.

---

### Description  

Because `math.asin()` is a static function, it is always used as `math.asin()`, rather than as a method of a lua object. This function is commonly used to compute the angle corresponding to a given sine value.

### Examples  

#### Using `math.asin()`  

```lua
print(math.asin(-1))       -- -1.5707963267949 (-π/2)
print(math.asin(0))        -- 0
print(math.asin(0.5))      -- 0.5235987755983 (π/6)
print(math.asin(1))        -- 1.5707963267949 (π/2)
```

#### Handling out-of-range values  

If the input value is outside the range `[-1, 1]`, the result is undefined, and an error or `nil` may occur.

```lua
-- Correct usage:
print(math.asin(0.75))     -- A valid angle in radians

-- Incorrect usage:
-- print(math.asin(2))      -- Error: argument out of range
```
