## `math.ult()`

### Baseline  
Available in lua 5.3 and later.

The `math.ult()` function returns a boolean value indicating whether one integer is less than another when treated as unsigned integers.

### Syntax  

```lua
math.ult(m, n)
```

### Parameters  

- **m**: An integer to compare.
- **n**: Another integer to compare against.

### Return Value  

- Returns `true` if `m` is less than `n` when both are treated as unsigned integers.
- Returns `false` otherwise.

### Description  

The `math.ult` function compares two integers, `m` and `n`, by treating them as unsigned values. This is particularly useful for comparing negative integers or large positive integers where overflow might occur if treated as signed integers. 

### Examples  

#### Basic usage of `math.ult()`

```lua
print(math.ult(5, 10))        -- Output: true (5 is less than 10)
print(math.ult(10, 5))        -- Output: false (10 is not less than 5)
print(math.ult(-1, 0))        -- Output: false (unsigned comparison; -1 is treated as a large unsigned number)
print(math.ult(0, 1))         -- Output: true (0 is less than 1)
print(math.ult(255, 256))     -- Output: true (255 is less than 256)
print(math.ult(256, 255))     -- Output: false (256 is not less than 255)
print(math.ult(math.huge, 1)) -- Output: false (infinity is not less than 1)
```
