## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## ðŸš… foo bar.. WTF?!

Straightforward examples with language you can understand.

No more `foo`, `bar`, `t`, `h`, `a` to represent non descriptive things.

Consistent across the documentation. 

No more will you get confused seeing one value being respresented in 10different names.

This documentation uses clear langauge that benefits beginners and advanced in understanding the concepts and functions of Lua.
