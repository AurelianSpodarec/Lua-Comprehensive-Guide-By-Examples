## What is LuaDocs?

LuaDocs is an unofficial documentation resource for the Lua programming language. It was created to solve the frustrations many developers face when learning Lua or navigating the official Lua documentation, which is just a book. The official resources, while thorough, can often feel dense and difficult to reference during practical development.

LuaDocs focuses on delivering clear, concise, and modern examples that are easy to understand and apply. Whether you're a newcomer exploring Lua for the first time or an experienced developer seeking quick answers, LuaDocs is designed to simplify your journey with practical insights and straightforward explanations.

By bridging the gaps left by the Lua book, LuaDocs aims to be the guide that Lua developers have always needed.
