# Naming of Position
In Doctosaurus, each file can be assigned a `sidebar_position` to determine its placement in the sidebar navigation. This positioning is essential for maintaining an organized and user-friendly structure.

To ensure flexibility and ease of maintenance, we use increments of 100 for the sidebar positions. This approach prevents us from using single-digit values (e.g., 1, 2), which would make it harder to manage and rearrange the sidebar later on. By using a scale of 100, we can easily insert new files between existing ones by assigning them values that fall between the current positions (e.g., using 100 for the first position and 150 for a new file placed between it and 200).

### Example
- **Position 1**: 100
- **Position 2**: 200
- **Position to Insert**: 150 (to place a new file between Position 1 and Position 2)

This system allows for clear hierarchy and straightforward adjustments to the sidebar structure without disrupting the overall order.

## Repository setup

1. Start by cloning the repo on your local machine.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AurelianSpodarec/LuaDocs
    ```

2. Install dependencies on your local. Please do not update any dependencies along with a feature request. If you find stale dependencies, create a separate PR to update them.

   We use `npm` for managing dependencies, therefore do not use `yarn` or any other tool.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. To start dev server execute the following command.

    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```
