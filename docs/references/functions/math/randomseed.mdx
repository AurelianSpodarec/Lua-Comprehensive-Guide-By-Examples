  title: math.randomseed() 
---

The `math.randomseed` function initializes the pseudo-random number generator used by `math.random`. It allows for reproducibility in random number sequences by providing a specific seed. Equal seeds will produce the same sequence of random numbers, making it useful for testing and debugging.

### Syntax  

```lua
math.randomseed(x [, y])
```

### Parameters  

- **x**: The first integer parameter that will be used to generate the seed. This value is combined with the second parameter to form a 128-bit seed.
- **y** (optional): The second integer parameter that is combined with `x`. If omitted, it defaults to `0`.

### Return Value  

Returns the two seed components that were effectively used to initialize the random generator. This allows for resetting the seed to reproduce the same sequence of random numbers.

### Description  

When called with no arguments, Lua generates a seed using a weak attempt at randomness, which may not provide a sufficiently random starting point for all applications. To ensure a required level of randomness or to have a deterministic sequence for debugging purposes, you should call `math.randomseed` with explicit arguments.

### Examples  

#### Setting a seed for random number generation

```lua
math.randomseed(os.time()) -- Initialize the random generator with the current time
```

#### Reproducing a sequence of random numbers

```lua
math.randomseed(12345) -- Set a specific seed

for i = 1, 5 do
    print(math.random(1, 100)) -- Will produce the same sequence each time
end
```

#### Using two arguments for the seed

```lua
math.randomseed(12345, 67890) -- Set a seed using two integers
```
