  title: math.pi
---

The `math.pi` constant represents the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi), which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

### Value  

```
\[
\text{math.pi} \approx 3.14159
\]
```

### Property Attributes  

- **Writable:** no  
- **Enumerable:** no  
- **Configurable:** no  

### Description  

Since `pi` is a constant in the `math` library, it is accessed as `math.pi`, rather than as a property of an object. It is commonly used in mathematical calculations involving circles, such as finding the circumference or area.

### Examples  

#### Using `math.pi`

The following function calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius:

```lua
function calculateCircumference(radius)
  return math.pi * (radius * 2)
end

print(calculateCircumference(1)) -- Output: 6.283185307179586
```

#### Using `math.pi` to calculate the area of a circle

```lua
function calculateArea(radius)
  return math.pi * radius * radius
end

print(calculateArea(1)) -- Output: 3.141592653589793
```
